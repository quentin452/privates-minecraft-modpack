    # yourself!).
    # - The <Block display name> is what people will see ingame while holding the block.
    # - The <Block texture> should be one in the 'assets/minecraft/blocks' folder in the resource
    # pack without the .png.
    # - The <Block material> is one of the default materials (determines some things about
    # the block like footstep sounds and such). The possible values are:

    # 
    # - If <Falls> is true, the block will fall like sand.
    # - If <Beacon Base> is true, the block can be used for beacon bases.
    # - The <Hardness> is a float that determines how long the block takes to break. If it is
    # negative, the block will be unbreakable like bedrock.
    # - The <Explosion resistance> is a float that represents how resistant the block is to explosions.
    # - The <Harvesting item type> is a tool type. The default options are 'pickaxe', 'shovel',
    # 'axe', or 'none'.
    # - The <Harvest level> is what level of tool can harvest the block if the tool type is not
    # 'none'; the default levels are wood and gold = 0, stone = 1, iron = 2, and diamond = 3.
    # - The <Light emitted> is how much the block glows, from 0.0 to 1.0.
    # - The <Slipperiness> is how slippery the block is, with 0.6 as normal and ice as 0.98.
    # - The higher the <Fire spread speed>, the faster the block will catch fire (0 for none).
    # - The higher the <Flammability>, the faster the block will burn and disappear (0 for none).
    # - The <Opacity> is how opaque the block is, with 0 being transparent, and 255 being almost

    # 'lootplusplus:' will be added to the front; don't add anything with a colon
    # yourself!).
    # - The <Block display name> is what people will see ingame while holding the block.

    # pack without the .png.
    # - The <Existing block name> is the name of the block the slab should be based on.
    # - The <Existing block metadata> is the metadata of the block it is based on.
    # - The <Pressed time> is how many ticks the button will stay pressed for. For wood buttons
    # this is 30, and for stone, 20 (Note there are 20 ticks per second).
    # - If <Arrows trigger> is true, arrows will set off the button.

    # For an example, if you wanted to add a ruby button, which presses for 2 seconds, you could put:

    # - The <Weight> is how many valid entities have to be on the plate for it to output a full
    # restone signal.
    # - <What triggers> determines what sets off the pressure plate. The valid options are
    # 
    #       everything, mobs, players
